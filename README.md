# üíª | SUBIND WEB PROJECT 

The company Subind, located in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon. Mexico; requested a website that had to meet different requirements according to their area of work.

Subind is dedicated to the manufacture of electrical panels and cabinets, so the most important thing to highlight in the project was the following:

* Product section with general description, images, catalog and technical data sheet.

This is how the project was done; making it have newsletter integrations in its footer with Sendinblue API and others.

Currently, this website is published in https://subind.mx

# ‚≠ê | MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE PROJECT 

This is my first web project, so I am proud of what was accomplished. It was a great challenge for me, as I did everything as I was learning in my web development courses.

Nevertheless, I am happy with the results. I know that this project can be improved and in the future I will do it as I improve my skills.

What do you think about the project?  Help me by leaving your feedback via email: jesus.saguilan@sabarc.com

Greetings! üëã
